<h1>Scanning-a-target-machine-for-open-ports</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The project focuses on identifying and analyzing open ports on a target machine to assess its security posture. Using network scanning tools like Nmap, this project helps uncover services and applications running on the target, which could potentially be vulnerable to attacks. The goal is to provide a detailed report on open ports, their associated services, and any security risks they may present, enabling system administrators or security professionals to take necessary steps to harden the target machine.
